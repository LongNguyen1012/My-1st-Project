I want to merge these data sets into one single data set, extract the mean and standard deviation measurement, and calculate the mean of these variables for each activity and each subject.\r\n\r\n#Study design and data processing\r\n##Collection of the raw data\r\n\r\nRaw data is: inertial signals which include the total and body acceleration signals in the X-Y-Z direction and body gyro signals in the X-Y-Z direction. These raw signals are then used to calculate the following signals:\r\n\"XYZ\" is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.\r\n```\r\ntBodyAcc-XYZ : time domain body acceleration\r\ntGravityAcc-XYZ : time domain gravity acceleration\r\ntBodyAccJerk-XYZ : time domain body acceleration jerk\r\ntBodyGyro-XYZ : time domain body gyro\r\ntBodyGyroJerk-XYZ : time domain body gyro jerk\r\ntBodyAccMag : time domain body acceleration magnitude\r\ntGravityAccMag : time domain gravity acceleration magnitude\r\ntBodyAccJerkMag : time domain body acceleration jerk magnitude\r\ntBodyGyroMag : time domain body gyro magnitude\r\ntBodyGyroJerkMag : time domain body gyro jerk magnitude\r\nfBodyAcc-XYZ : frequency domain body acceleration\r\nfBodyAccJerk-XYZ : frequency domain body acceleration jerk\r\nfBodyGyro-XYZ : frequency domain body gyro\r\nfBodyAccMag : frequency domain body acceleration magnitude\r\nfBodyAccJerkMag : frequency domain body acceleration jerk magnitude\r\nfBodyGyroMag : frequency domain body gyro magnitude\r\nfBodyGyroJerkMag : frequency domain body gyro jerk magnitude\r\n```\r\nThe set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: \r\n```\r\nmean(): Mean value\r\nstd(): Standard deviation\r\nmad(): Median absolute deviation \r\nmax(): Largest value in array\r\nmin(): Smallest value in array\r\nsma(): Signal magnitude area\r\nenergy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. \r\niqr(): Interquartile range \r\nentropy(): Signal entropy\r\narCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4\r\ncorrelation(): correlation coefficient between two signals\r\nmaxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude\r\nmeanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency\r\nskewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal \r\nkurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal \r\nbandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.\r\nangle(): Angle between two vectors.\r\n```\r\nAdditional vectors that are used on the angle() variable:\r\n```\r\ngravityMean : gravity mean\r\ntBodyAccMean : mean of time domain body acceleration mean\r\ntBodyAccJerkMean : mean of time domain body acceleration jerk\r\ntBodyGyroMean : mean of time domain body gyro\r\ntBodyGyroJerkMean : mean of time domain body gyro jerk\r\n```\r\nThese variables values are stored in X_train.txt (for train subjects) and X_test.txt (for test subjects), while the complete list of variables names are available in features.txt\r\n\r\nEach person performed six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying). The number associated with each activity is as follow:\r\n```\r\n1 Walking\r\n2 Walking upstairs\r\n3 Walking downstairs\r\n4 Sitting\r\n5 Standing\r\n6 Laying\r\n```\r\nThese activity labels are stored in activity_labels.txt\r\n\r\nEach activity is repeated several times for each subject. The signal variables as mentioned above are calculated for each performed activity. There are total 561 signal variables.\r\n\r\nEach subject is assigned a subject id. Subject id ranges from 1 - 30. The information about which subject perform which particular activity is stored in subject_train.txt (for train subjects) and subject_test.txt (for test subject)\r\n\r\nThe task is to take information from the variable values files, the subject id file, the activity labels file, and the features file to create one complete data set that include all the measurements of all the activities for each subject id. Then it's required that all but the measurements of mean and standard deviation will be exluded from the date set. Names of the signal variables should be changed to make it easy for indexing and downstream analysis. Also each activity should be clearly labeled (not numbered) for easy reading  \r\n\r\n##Guide to clean and create the tidy data:\r\n\r\nFirst, the data for train subjects and test subjects are loaded into R. These data includes: signal variable values (X_train.txt. X_test.txt), subject id (sbject_train.txt, subject_test.txt), variable names (features.txt), and activity index number (y_train.txt, y_test.txt)\r\n\r\nThen the variable names in features.txt is assigned to each column in X_train and X_test\r\n\r\nSince activity index data set (for both train and test subjects) is just a column vector of index number without names, the column is assigned the name \"activity\"\r\n\r\nThe subject id data set (for both train and test subjects) is also just a column vector of ids with no name, the column is assigned the name \"subjectid\"\r\n\r\nFrom the signal variables values X_train and X_test data, a function was run to retain only variables with the name \"mean\" or \"std\" since we only interested in mean and standard deviation measurements.\r\n\r\nThe activity index data set was orignially a factor with levels 1-6 with no labels for each level. File activity_labels.txt is loaded and each index number is assigned with a particular name:\r\n```\r\n1 walk\r\n2 walkupstair\r\n3 walkdownstair\r\n4 sit\r\n5 stand\r\n6 lay\r\n```\r\nThe subject id, the activities, the signal variables data are then combined to create \"finaldata\" which has dimensions of:\r\n\r\n10299 observations (rows) record of each activity for each subject\r\n563 columns, which includes sunject id, activity, and 561 signal variables\r\n\r\nThe names of variables are then processed to remove \"-\" and \"()\" for ease in further analysis and indexing.\r\n\r\nSubject id is converted to factor and the signal variables are converted to numeric for downstream analysis.\r\n\r\n##Guide to create tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.\r\n\r\nTwo seperate data sets are created from \"finaldata\"\r\n\r\nactivity_mean: this data set contains the mean of each signal variable in \"finaldata\" for each particular activity\r\nsubject_mean: this data set contains the mean of each signal variable in \"finaldata\" for each particular subject\r\n\r\nIn activity_mean data set, each variable name is modified to include \"activity\" at the end to note that this is the measurement for an activity, not a subject. Also, in subject_mean data set, each variable name is modified to include \"subject\" at the end to note that this is the measurement for a subject, not an activity.\r\n\r\nThen two data sets are combined by the following method: for each subject id, there will be 6 associated activities(walk, walkupstair, walkdownstair, sit, stand, lay). These activities will be followed by the mean measurements for each activity, and following that is the mean measurement for that particular subject:\r\n```\r\nsubjectid < activity < mean1-activity < mean2-activity < mean1-subject < mean2-subject\r\n1           walk                  a                   g               A               B\r\n1           walkupstair           b                   h               A               B\r\n1           walkdownstair         c                   i               A               B\r\n1           sit                   d                   j               A               B\r\n1           stand                 e                   k               A               B\r\n1           lay                   f                   l               A               B\r\n```\r\nSubject id and activity column are changed to factor for ease in further analysis and indexing\r\n\r\nThe final data set will be stored in data set \"new\" and export to newdata.txt\r\n\r\n#Description of the variables in the newdata.txt file\r\n\r\nThe dimension: \r\n\r\n30 subject x 6 activities = 180 observations (rows) \r\n160 variables (columns): include subject id, activity, mean of each variables for each activity, mean of each variable for each subject\r\n\r\nSubject id is a factor vector with levels 1-30 indicate the id for each subject.\r\nActivity is a factor with levels: walk, walkupstair, walkdownstair, sit, stand, lay.\r\nList of variables with \"activity\" at the end of name: indicate the mean of this particular measurement for each variable.\r\nList of variables with \"subject\" at the end of name: indicate the mean of this particular measurement for each subject.\r\n\r\nThe example data structure is as
